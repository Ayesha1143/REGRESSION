# Food Delivery Time Prediction Using Regression 🍔🚴‍♂️

This project aims to predict food delivery time using regression techniques.
The model analyzes various factors related to orders, delivery distance, and conditions to estimate the expected delivery duration.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and follows a complete machine learning regression workflow.
